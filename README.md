# LFX v2 Auth Service

A NATS-based authentication and user management microservice for the LFX v2 platform. This service provides an abstraction layer between applications and identity providers (Auth0 and Authelia).

## Overview

The LFX v2 Auth Service provides authentication and profile access in the v2 Platform, serving as an abstraction layer between applications and identity providers (Auth0 and Authelia). This service enables user management, profile updates, email/social account linking, and user discovery while maintaining compatibility across different deployment environments.

The service operates as a NATS-based microservice, responding to request/reply patterns on specific subjects.

### Prerequisites
- Go 1.24.5+
- NATS server
- Auth0 configuration (optional, defaults to mock mode)
- Kubernetes cluster (for local Authelia development setup)

### Local Development Support

The auth-service supports **Authelia + NATS KV** integration for local development environments. This setup provides:

- **Authelia** as a local identity provider running in Kubernetes
- **NATS Key-Value store** for persistent user data storage
- **Automatic synchronization** between NATS KV and Authelia's ConfigMap/Secrets
- **DaemonSet restart capability** when user data changes require Authelia pod restarts

For detailed information about the Authelia integration architecture and sync mechanisms, see: [`internal/infrastructure/authelia`](internal/infrastructure/authelia)

## Usage

### NATS Request/Reply Pattern

The LFX v2 Auth Service operates as a NATS-based microservice that responds to request/reply patterns on specific subjects. The service provides user management capabilities through NATS messaging.

### Available Operations

The service provides the following groups of operations:

#### Email Lookup Operations
Look up users by their email addresses to retrieve usernames or subject identifiers.

**Subjects:**
- `lfx.auth-service.email_to_username` - Look up username by email
- `lfx.auth-service.email_to_sub` - Look up subject identifier by email

**[View Email Lookup Documentation](docs/email_lookups.md)**

---

#### User Metadata Operations
Retrieve and update user profile metadata using various input types (JWT tokens, subject identifiers, or usernames).

**Subjects:**
- `lfx.auth-service.user_metadata.read` - Retrieve user metadata
- `lfx.auth-service.user_metadata.update` - Update user profile

**[View User Metadata Documentation](docs/user_metadata.md)**

---

#### Email Verification Flow
Two-step verification flow for verifying ownership of alternate email addresses.

**Subjects:**
- `lfx.auth-service.email_linking.send_verification` - Send OTP to email
- `lfx.auth-service.email_linking.verify` - Verify email with OTP

📖 **[View Email Verification Documentation](docs/email_verification.md)**

---

#### Identity Linking
Link verified identities (such as verified email addresses) to user accounts.

**Subjects:**
- `lfx.auth-service.user_identity.link` - Link verified identity to user

**[View Identity Linking Documentation](docs/identity_linking.md)**

---

### Email Verification and Linking Flow

The following diagram shows the complete three-step flow for verifying an alternate email address and linking it to a user account:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant SSRApp
    participant AuthService
    participant Auth0

    Note over User,Auth0: Step 1: Start Email Verification Flow
    
    User->>SSRApp: Request to link alternate email
    SSRApp->>AuthService: NATS: email_linking.send_verification<br/>(alternate email)
    
    AuthService->>AuthService: Validate email format
    AuthService->>AuthService: Check email doesn't exist<br/>(primary or alternate)
    
    AuthService->>Auth0: Start Passwordless Flow<br/>(send OTP to email)
    Auth0-->>User: Email with OTP code
    Auth0-->>AuthService: Success
    AuthService-->>SSRApp: {"success": true,<br/>"message": "verification sent"}
    SSRApp-->>User: Show OTP input modal

    Note over User,Auth0: Step 2: Verify Email with OTP
    
    User->>SSRApp: Submit OTP code
    SSRApp->>AuthService: NATS: email_linking.verify<br/>(email + OTP)
    
    AuthService->>AuthService: Validate email format
    AuthService->>AuthService: Check email still doesn't exist<br/>(prevent race condition)
    
    AuthService->>Auth0: Exchange OTP for ID token<br/>(using service credentials)
    Auth0-->>AuthService: ID token
    AuthService-->>SSRApp: {"success": true,<br/>"data": {"token": "..."}}
    
    Note over User,Auth0: Step 3: Link Identity to User
    
    SSRApp->>AuthService: NATS: user_identity.link<br/>(user_token, link_with)
    AuthService->>AuthService: Parse JWT token<br/>(extract user_id from 'sub')
    AuthService->>Auth0: POST /users/{id}/identities<br/>(using user's token)
    Auth0-->>AuthService: Linked identities
    AuthService-->>SSRApp: {"success": true,<br/>"message": "identity linked"}
    SSRApp-->>User: Email linked successfully
```

**Flow Steps:**
- **Step 1-2:** Email verification process - see [Email Verification Documentation](docs/email_verification.md)
- **Step 3:** Identity linking - see [Identity Linking Documentation](docs/identity_linking.md)

### Configuration

##### NATS Configuration

The NATS client can be configured using environment variables:

- `NATS_URL`: NATS server URL (default: `nats://localhost:4222`)
- `NATS_TIMEOUT`: Request timeout duration (default: `10s`)
- `NATS_MAX_RECONNECT`: Maximum reconnection attempts (default: `3`)
- `NATS_RECONNECT_WAIT`: Time between reconnection attempts (default: `2s`)

##### Auth0 Configuration

The Auth0 integration can be configured using environment variables:

- `USER_REPOSITORY_TYPE`: Set to `"auth0"` to use Auth0 integration, or `"mock"` for local development
  - **If not set, defaults to `"mock"`**
- `AUTH0_TENANT`: Auth0 tenant name (e.g., `"linuxfoundation"`, `"linuxfoundation-staging"`, `"linuxfoundation-dev"`)
  - **Required when using Auth0 repository type**
- `AUTH0_DOMAIN`: Auth0 domain for Management API calls (e.g., `"sso.linuxfoundation.org"`)
  - **If not set, defaults to `${AUTH0_TENANT}.auth0.com`**
- `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID`: Auth0 Machine-to-Machine application client ID
  - **Required when using Auth0 repository type**
- `AUTH0_PRIVATE_BASE64_KEY`: Base64-encoded private key for Auth0 M2M authentication
  - **Required when using Auth0 repository type**
- `AUTH0_AUDIENCE`: Auth0 API audience/identifier for the Management API
  - **Required when using Auth0 repository type**

## Releases

### Creating a Release

To create a new release of the auth service:

1. **Update the chart version** in `charts/lfx-v2-auth-service/Chart.yaml` prior to any project releases, or if any
   change is made to the chart manifests or configuration:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2.0  # Increment this version
   appVersion: "latest"  # Keep this as "latest"
   ```

2. **After the pull request is merged**, create a GitHub release and choose the
   option for GitHub to also tag the repository. The tag must follow the format
   `v{version}` (e.g., `v0.2.0`). This tag does _not_ have to match the chart
   version: it is the version for the project release, which will dynamically
   update the `appVersion` in the released chart.

3. **The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically**:
   - Build and publish the container images (auth-service)
   - Package and publish the Helm chart to GitHub Pages
   - Publish the chart to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
   - Sign the chart with Cosign
   - Generate SLSA provenance

### Important Notes

- The `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml` should always remain `"latest"` in the committed code.
- During the release process, the `ko-build-tag.yaml` workflow automatically overrides the `appVersion` with the actual tag version (e.g., `v0.2.0` becomes `0.2.0`).
- Only update the chart `version` field when making releases - this represents the Helm chart version.
- The container image tags are automatically managed by the consolidated CI/CD pipeline using the git tag.
- Both container images (auth-service) and the Helm chart are published together in a single workflow.
